安装环境变量：
vim .bash_profile
```shell
spark@mv161p120 ~]$ vim .bash_profile 
```
增加如下内容：
```
SPARK_HOME=/home/spark/spark-3.1.1-bin-hadoop2.7
PATH=$PATH:$SPARK_HOME/bin
export PATH SPARK_HOME

```
执行source让环境变量生效：
```shell
spark@mv161p120 ~]$ source .bash_profile 
```

# 3.生成数据
```shell
[spark@mv161p120 ~]$ mkdir -p tpcds-data-1g

# ColumnPruning
列裁剪在 Spark SQL 中由 ColumnPruning 实现。因为我们查询的表可能有很多个字段，但是每次查询我们很大可能不需要扫描出所有的字段，这个时候利用列裁剪可以把那些查询不需要的字段过滤掉，使得扫描的数据量减少。

这个优化一方面大幅度减少了网络、内存数据量消耗，另一方面对于列存格式（Parquet）来说大大提高了扫描效率。

# PushDownPredicates
PushDownPredicates是谓词下推规则，这个过程主要将过滤条件尽可能地下推到底层，最好是贴近数据源。

谓词下推能将过滤条件下推到JOIN之前进行，这样在扫描数据的时候就对数据进行了过滤，参与JOIN的数据量将会得到显著地减少，JOIN耗时必然也会降低。

从执行计划来看，就是将Filter下推到Join之前先执行。
